1. Install Git

Download Git from the official website.
Run the installer and follow the instructions.
During installation, select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" to use Git in CMD.

2. Verify Installation

git --version

Output Example:

git version 2.x.x



5. Initialize a Git Repository
Navigate to your project folder:

cd path/to/your/project
Initialize a new Git repository:

git init    - #This creates a hidden .git folder in your project directory.
git add .   - #Add files to the staging area:
git commit -m "Initial commit"  - #Commit the changes:

7. Connect to a Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub)

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git        #Add a remote repository URL:
git push -u origin main                #Push the changes to the remote repository:

git status     #Check the status of the repository:


git pull origin main    #Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git    #Clone an existing repository:


These steps will set up Git on your system and allow you to manage repositories. Let me know if you need further guidance!
